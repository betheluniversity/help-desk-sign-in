This project is designed to help Justin keep track
of his students' work hours at the Help Desk with
an RFID scanner to track the start and end of each
student's work shift (like clocking in and out).

The first tasks of the project is to set up the
interface and sync Python to work with Google
Sheets, which is where Justin currently tracks
his students' work attendance.
