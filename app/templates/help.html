              <h6>What is a "bad" shift?</h6>
                  <p>
                      A "bad" shift is a shift that is caught by the program as one of the following problem-cases:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Student is 8 or more minutes late to their shift.</li>
                      <li>Student's shift duration is 8 or more minutes less than the scheduled shift duration (e.g., student stays for 1 hour, 51 minutes or less of a 2 hour shift).</li>
                      <li>Student skips their shift or forgets to clock their shift entirely.</li>
                      <li>
                          Student forgets to clock out of their shift. If the student forgets to clock in, but clocks out, such action will be treated as a successful clock in and a missed clock out and marked the same.
                          This is treated as "bad" because it is unknown when they left their shift if there is not data from both the clock in and clock out times.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
              <h6>What do each of the buttons do?</h6>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Process Shift Data: This button runs the code to analyze the differences between the shift schedule entered by you into the 'hd_export' sheet and the scanned shifts from the student employees.</li>
                      <li>
                          Flagged Shifts: This button opens the 'flagged_shifts' sheet within the Google Sheet for this page. The 'flagged_shifts' sheet contains the collected data of "bad" shifts after
                          the shift processor analyzes the shifts between the 'hd_export' and 'scan_input' sheets when the "Process Shift Data" button is clicked.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Help Desk Schedule: This button opens the 'hd_export' sheet, which contains the student shift schedule entered by you. The time period of the starting and ending shifts of this data you input will be
                          the time period analyzed by the shift processor when you click the "Process Shift Data" button. This sheet clears when the "Process Shift Data" button is clicked.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Scanner Data: This button opens the 'scan_input' sheet, collecting data as students scan their IDs on the RFID scanner. Each shift is documented in this sheet and cleared when the "Process Shift Data"
                          button is clicked.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Student Employees: This button opens the 'hd_users' sheet, which contains the list of current student employees at the Help Desk, or any students you want signing in and out of shifts. Any student you
                          want signing in and out of shifts with the scanner must have their full name and card ID entered in this sheet.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
              <h6>What do I need to do before clicking the "Process Shift Data" button?</h6>
                  <p>
                      The list of student employees and their corresponding user information must be up to date in the 'hd_users' sheet.
                      Information required for each student includes their full name and the 5-digit card ID on the back of their Bethel ID cards.
                      The card ID is upside-down on the top-middle of the card, above the magnetic strip.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The date range should roughly match between the lists of shifts in the 'hd_export' and 'scan_input' sheets of the Google Sheet.
                      The "Process Shift Data" program can handle as many shifts in the 'hd_export' and 'scan_input' sheets as desired and can post as many shifts as needed to the 'flagged_shifts' sheet.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The shift processor will run properly if the date ranges do not match up completely. However, it will work best if they do.
                      <li>
                          If the start or end dates for 'scan_input' are earlier or later than 'hd_export', respectively, all shifts for those earlier or later dates in 'scan_input' will be ignored by the program and not
                          marked as anything. The program only searches through the date range of 'hd_export'.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          The 'hd_export' and 'scan_input' sheets clear all data when the program runs. Thus, if scan_input contains data beyond that of the range of 'hd_export', it will be lost when the button is clicked.
                          Make sure to copy or save the shifts in 'scan_input' that run past the end date of 'hd_export' before clicking the button if this is the case.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
              <h6>What happens when I click the "Process Shift Data" button?</h6>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The shift processor gathers and compares shift data from the 'hd_export' and 'scan_input' sheets, recording when a "bad" shift occurs during the comparison.</li>
                      <li>
                          All "bad" shifts are logged into the 'flagged_shifts' sheet of the Google Sheet. Once the site gives you an alert that the program has completed,
                          follow the "Flagged Shifts" button to open the 'flagged_shifts' sheet in a new tab.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          The 'flagged_shifts' sheet clears prior to the running of the program, posting only new data to the sheet.
                          The 'hd_export' and 'scan_input' sheets clear following the running of the program to begin accepting new data.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
              <h6>What does the "server exhausted" error message mean?</h6>
                <p>
                    The "server exhausted" error occurs when the Google Sheet receives too many requests in a short time to receive or send data between one of the sheets and the code in the program.
                    This error can occur at three instances on the site: running the "Process Shift Data" program, scanning IDs to clock in or out of shifts, and accessing the home page with the table of student shifts for the day.
                    If the error appears when running the "Process Shift Data" button, shorten the number of shifts in 'hd_export' and 'scan_input' to limit the number of "bad" shifts posting to 'flagged_shifts'.
                    While the error is unlikely to occur during normal use, when the error appears, waiting 60 seconds or so and refreshing the page will typically solve the problem.
                    If the error appears multiple times, wait another minute and it should fix itself. If the problem persists, contact the Web team.

              <h6>How do the students clock in and out and where is the information stored?</h6>
              <p>
                  Students can clock in and out of their shifts by scanning their Bethel ID cards on the RFID scanner at the Help Desk.
                  When a student clocks in or out, their card ID matches with their user info from the 'hd_users' sheet in the Google Sheet.
                  Upon matching, the timestamp is recorded as either a clock in or out and is sent to the 'scan_input' sheet as well as displayed on the home page of the site.
                  The 'Time Clock' tab (home page) of the site displays the current day's recorded shifts from the full list of shifts.
                  All other shifts remain in the 'scan_input' sheet out of the students' view.
